      <h3>The Myth of the Muse</h3>
      <p>Let's begin by dismantling the most destructive myth in the creative arts: the myth of the muse. This is the romantic notion of the writer as a vessel for divine inspiration, waiting patiently for a lightning bolt of genius to strike. When it does, the story pours out, fully formed and perfect. This is a fantasy. Waiting for the muse is an excuse for not writing.</p>
